  Implemention of the "tee" command.
  3) It took a while to read through the documentation for file IO. I started with trying to use fgets, but ran into difficult so I just tried fgetc and went with that instead. I'd like to try to get htat to work next time. Also, more error checking.
  4) Uses malloc/better use of pointers. It also has no comments. Seems to care more about space allocation.
